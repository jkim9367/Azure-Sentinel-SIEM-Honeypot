# Azure_Sentinel_SIEM_Honeypot
I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and created virtual machine acting as a honey pot. Observed live attacks, RDP Brute Force, from all around the world and use custom PowerShell script to display the attackers' Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map.
